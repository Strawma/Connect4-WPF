# Connect4-WPF
Adjustments made to my NoughtsAndCrosses to make it play Connect 4 instead. Written in C# using WPF.

Includes all the C# scripts I wrote for the application
- ConfigWindow.cs: settings window. allows user to adjust game settings (win condition, grid size, AI, modes)
- CustomWindow.cs: customisation window. allows user to customise their game (background, music, icons)
- GameWindow.cs: window for main game. allows user to play game
- MainWindow.cs: main menu window. allows user to access other windows
- Startup.cs: setup script that runs once at startup
- Utils.cs: contains functions used across windows

Unfortunately DOES NOT Include the actual VS Project File :(
