# Connect4-WPF
Adjustments made to my NoughtsAndCrosses to make it play Connect 4 instead. Written in C# using WPF.

Includes all the C# scripts I wrote for the application
- ConfigWindow.cs: settings window
- CustomWindow.cs: customisation window
- GameWindow.cs: window for main game
- MainWindow.cs: main menu window
- Startup.cs: startup script
- Utils.cs: contains functions used across windows

Unfortunately DOES NOT Include the actual VS Project File :(
